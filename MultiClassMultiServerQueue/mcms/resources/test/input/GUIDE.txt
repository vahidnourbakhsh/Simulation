Each instance has three files:
	- Agents: It includes the number of agents in each group i
	- Demands: It includes the demand/arrival rate of each contact type k
	- Routes: It includes the service time. The time it takes for an agent in group i to serve a contact of type k

Naming Convention:
	Each file starts with an example number, e.g.:
		- 1agents.dat
		- 1demands.dat
		- 1routes.dat

For formatting data read below or refer to the instructions in each of the input files:

In each input data file, lines that start with hash tag sign # are treated as comments. 
The data loader would ignore all comment lines including the header line.
The data is presented in lines. In each line the last column is the parameter value. The first columns are indices, that is, k for contact and i for agent group.
Start the indices from zero and keep the order, smallest to largest.

Agents File Data Format (Line 9, ...):
# i		num_agents
  0		2
  1		4
  2		1
  3		2

Demands File Data Format (Line 9, ...):
# k		arrival_rate
  0		4
  1		8
  2		2
  
Routes File Data Format (Line 9, ...):
# k		i		service_time
  0		0		2
  0		1		1.5
  0		2		1.7
  1		1		3
  1		2		4
  2		0		10
  2		1		2
Note that if a routing/assignment is not feasible, simply do not include it in the routes file. For example, in the above example, group 0 does not serve contact type 1.

##### TEST PROBLEMS #####
We have two test problems:
## Problem 1 ## 
This test problem consists of one group (with two agent) and one contact type.
# EXPECTED OUTPUT: #
Example number: 1
	 Number of contact types: 1
 	 Number of agent groups: 1
 	 Acceptable Waiting Time: 10.0

Simulation setting: 
 	 Number Periods: 14
 	 Nummer Main Periods (excluding warm-up and wrap-up periods): 12
 	 Each Period's Length: 86400.0
 	 Number Replications: 10
	 Total Net Simulation Duration (Num Main Periods * Each Period's Length * Num Replications): 86400.0

Simulation results (average over replications):
	 Total number of contacts arrived at the system: 8613
	 Total number of contacts served: 8613
	 Total number of contacts served within the acceptable waiting time of 10.0: 8613
	 Average number of contacts arrived at the system per unit time: 0.099687
	 Average number of contacts served per unit time: 0.099687
	 Average number of contacts served within the acceptable waiting time of 10.0 per unit time: 0.099687
	 EW(avg): Expected queue waiting time of a random contact arrived at the system: 0.158116
	 SL(avg): Average number of contacts that were served within the acceptable waiting time (defined per unit time): 0.099687

## Problem 2 ##
This test problem consists of two groups (one group with two and the other with three agents). There are two job type.
# EXPECTED OUTPUT: #
